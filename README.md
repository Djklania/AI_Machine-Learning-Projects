## Covid19 Radiograhy Dataset
This dataset provides radiographic images for COVID-19 detection. Utilizing both a simple convolutional network and a deeper convolutional network, this repository offers a valuable resource for studying and implementing deep learning models in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis.

## California Housing & Diabetes
This file is dedicated to the California Housing Dataset, a valuable resource for practicing linear regression. Based on the 1990 California census, this dataset allows you to work with a Linear Regression object to model and predict housing prices. Also the diabets dataset provides a valuable platform to study the relationship between various factors and diabetes progression. Utilizing XGBoost and SHAP, we aim to gain deeper insights into predictive modeling and interpretability

## Image Classification with different models
This file is dedicated to image classification, employing a range of model architectures such as Inception_v1, Inception_v2, Inception_v3, and Inception_ResNet_v2. Furthermore, we incorporate diverse baseline images for a comprehensive analysis.
